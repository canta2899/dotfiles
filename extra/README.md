# About extras

This directory aims to contain everything that doesn't belong to any other category in the repository. The two C programs included are

- `endianess.c` (Which provides a quick tool to check if the machine is Big or Little endian)
- `realpath.c` (Which provides a useful implementation of **realpath** since that on OS X it's not an available command)

The source code is provided because generally I would need to recompile the tool on a new architecture.
